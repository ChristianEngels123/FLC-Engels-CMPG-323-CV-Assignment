const aboutMeText = `<p>Hello, I'm <strong>Christian Engels</strong>, a third-year <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</strong> student from <strong>Upington, South Africa</strong>. I'm passionate about software development and system design, with a strong focus on creating practical, efficient solutions that address real-world challenges. Throughout my studies, I have enjoyed working on projects that combine both technical skills and creative problem-solving.

<p>I am constantly seeking opportunities to deepen my understanding of programming languages, software engineering principles, and emerging technologies. I believe that the best solutions come from a blend of careful planning, clear logic, and thoughtful design.</p>

<p>Outside of my academic work, I enjoy playing guitar, singing, and spending time in creative and collaborative environments. These interests help me maintain balance and inspire fresh perspectives in my development work.</p>
