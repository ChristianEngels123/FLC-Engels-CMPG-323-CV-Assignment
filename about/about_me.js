const aboutMeText = `<p>Hello, I'm <strong>Christian Engels</strong>, a third-year <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</strong> student from <strong>Upington, South Africa</strong>. I'm passionate about software development and system design, with a strong focus on creating practical, efficient solutions that address real-world challenges. Throughout my studies, I have enjoyed working on projects that combine both technical skills and creative problem-solving.

<p>I am constantly seeking opportunities to deepen my understanding of programming languages, software engineering principles, and emerging technologies. I believe that the best solutions come from a blend of careful planning, clear logic, and thoughtful design.</p>

<p>Outside of my academic work, I enjoy playing guitar, singing, and spending time in creative and collaborative environments. These interests help me maintain balance and inspire fresh perspectives in my development work.</p>

<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<p>In 2022 I ganined work experience through working as a <strong>Bartender</strong> at Rocking Potch for the duration of the Festival.</p>
<p>And in 2024 I gained further work experience and insight into <strong>Industry</strong> through shadowing the <strong>IT Department</strong> of KLK Landbou Ltd. for a week. During this time I assisted the company by helping to program routers under the supervision of their Main Programmer. I also lead a <strong>Research Project</strong> for the company, looking into the use of <strong>NFC Technology</strong> to create Membership Cards for Customers that have accounts at the company that would work through a Point-of-Sale System.</p>
